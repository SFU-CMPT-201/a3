# Build systems

Along with an editor, another important tool for development is a build system. A build system takes
care of compiling the source code of a program to generate executables, libraries, or sometimes
entire system images. If you have a single source file, you probably do not need a build system to
compile it. However, modern software often has countless source files with complex dependencies, and
a build system is necessary to manage them altogether.

The language we use for this course is C, and in this assignment, you will learn the basics of the
two of the most popular build systems for C, Make and CMake. These systems have many features and it
is not feasible to cover all the features in one assignment or lecture. Thus, you will learn just
the basics so you can use them in future assignments.
