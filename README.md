# Build systems

Along with an editor, another important tool for development is a build system. A build system takes care of compiling the source code of a program to generate executables, libraries, or sometimes entire system images. If you have a single source file, you probably do not need a build system to compile it. However, modern software often has countless source files with complex dependencies, and a build system is necessary to manage them altogether.

The language we use for this course is C, and in this assignment, you will learn the basics of the two of the most popular build systems for C, Make and CMake. These systems have many features and it is not feasible to cover all the features in one assignment or lecture. Thus, you will learn just the basics so you can use them in future assignments.
